This will be a program made with autohotkey, this version will be possible to be used without AutoHotkey installed.
It is used for going around the necessity of opening the battle.net launcher, but has only been proven to work as-is with Overwatch
The reason an exe version is in progress is so users do not need to install AutoHotkey, but are still able to debug it from a txt file.

release date: unknown
